*This is one of a series of posts stepping through the fundamentals laid out in The Pragmatic Progammer. These posts are in no way meant to replace reading the book, I'd highly recommend grabbing [a copy](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4099.The_Pragmatic_Programmer).*

As a software developer, your responsibility is to provide solutions rather than excuses for your code. While there are likely a variety of factors leading to any given failure  <!-- more -->(framework, coworkers, management, etc.), it ultimately falls on you to deliver.

So you've wrapped your head around this failure being yours, now what? Play out the conversation in your head. Are there other things you could try? If you've given it your best shot then present it to your boss or team, just don't bring them an undercooked solution without a side of options. It's a lot more palatable to chew on the-solution-that-wasn't when you have some good options laid out for what to do next. Also, don't be afraid to ask for help.

How would you feel if your mechanic or your bank teller gave you a lame excuse?

### Best paired beverage
Posts I've tagged as relating to "philosophy" won't usually have an alcoholic beverage pairing. I think it's important to iron out my philosophy with an unfettered perspective. With that said, I usually take my philosophy with some green tea.
