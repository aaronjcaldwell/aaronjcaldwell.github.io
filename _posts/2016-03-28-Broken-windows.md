title: Broken windows
layout: post
author: "Aaron Caldwell"
excerpt:
  The difference between a well-kept neighborhood and one that falls to pieces can begin with just one broken window. A broken window left unrepaired shows neglect and so people stop caring. Other windows are then broken intentionally, graffiti appears and pretty soon a once manageable situation becomes a truly unmanageable one.

The difference between a well-kept neighborhood and one that falls to pieces can begin with just one broken window. A broken window left unrepaired shows neglect and so people stop caring. Other windows are then broken intentionally, graffiti appears and pretty soon a once manageable situation becomes a truly unmanageable one.

On the flipside, imagine being in an immaculate and well-furnished house. The cookware is high-quality, the paintings are original and well-chosen and the carpets all hand-woven. Now imagine trying buy something that genuinely adds to this house and fits.

To build and maintain a good code base, developers need to guard against code decay through sloppy coding but at the same time, allow code to not be so meticulate as to be inaccessible for enhancement. While it's easy for a developer to agree with this in principle, tight deadlines make it easy to lose track of details. It's better here to strike a consistent balance and not sacrifice code quality.
